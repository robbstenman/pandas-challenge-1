# Module 4 Challenge

# Pandas Challenge 1
The file for this challenge is called module_4_challenge.ipynb.

Please ignore the files .DS_Store, .gitignore, and .gitignorertf. I have been trying to stop certain irrelevant files from being uploaded to my repositories, but have not yet been successful.

The file called wholesale_data_analysis_starter_code.ipynb was provided and was not altered.

### Part 4 - Summary of Findings
The main observation from this data is that the company is too reliant on a single client. Their largest client represents roughly three times as much profit as the next four clients put together. If they lose their largest client, the company will be in serious peril.

### Support
For this challenge, I used ChatGPT, Tabnine and discussions with other students. I have tried to schedule a tutor, but have been uable to find a time that works with my schedule. I was one cent off on Part 3 for each line item.  I have not been able to figure out why or how to correct this.
